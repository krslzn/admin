You can destroy a PC you have so much power but remember educational purpeses only  



-create viruses
-dos someone
-ddos someone
-remotecontrol desktop
-ip lookup
you can do anything you want 
i deleted all files that can harm your pc but if you want to create a virus you need to turn off you anti virus. some files may be empty cause i deleted all files that can harm your pc 

Disclamer again:

educational purpeses only
